1- Compiling the Onesocialweb client library (using Smack)

- Make sure that 'ant' is installed on your system
- Go in the main folder of the project
- Type 'ant' 
- The compiled jar is in build/jar/osw-lib-java.jar

The library jar only contains the onesocialweb classes. When you use the library in a project, make sure
that you also put the other dependencies in your classpath.
